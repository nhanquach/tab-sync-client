# Application Complaints

## 1. Visual Identity Crisis (Design Inconsistency) (DONE)

The application currently suffers from a severe lack of visual cohesion.

**The Problem:**
There is a jarring disconnect between the core application interface (Home, Sidebar, Tab Grid) and the secondary interfaces (Authentication, Dialogs).
- **Secondary Interfaces:** embrace a modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, featuring `backdrop-blur-xl`, asymmetric borders, and a sense of depth.
- **Core Interface:** clings to a flat, "Solid Geometric" style that feels dated and rigid by comparison.

**Why this matters:**
This inconsistency breaks user immersion and makes the product feel like a patchwork of two different templates (likely a clash between `shadcn/ui` customizations and legacy Material UI patterns). It screams "unfinished MVP" rather than "polished product."

**The Demand:**
Pick a lane and stick to it. If the Glassmorphism look of the `StatsDialog` and `SignIn` page is the intended direction (which it seems to be, as it's more distinctive), then **apply it universally**. The Sidebar should be frosted glass. The Tab Cards should have subtle borders and blur effects.

*Consistency is not a "nice-to-have" feature; it is the baseline for trust.*

## 2. Arbitrary Pagination Limits (Data Jail)

The application enforces a hardcoded limit of 20 items per page with no way to change it.

**The Problem:**
Users are restricted to viewing only 20 tabs at a time, regardless of their screen size or preference.

**Why this matters:**
This is hostile to power users. On a high-resolution display, 20 items leaves mostly empty space. More importantly, it breaks standard browser functionality: I cannot use `Ctrl+F` to find a tab if it's on page 2, 3, or 10. I am forced to click through pagination controls like it's 2005. I feel like I'm viewing my data through a keyhole.

**The Demand:**
Implement a density/pagination control immediately. Allow users to select 20, 50, 100, or "All" items per page. Respect my screen real estate and my intelligence.
